#IMPORTANT INFO
Mousai2 is now open sourced due to the lack of me having the time and a a jailbroken device to compile it on and since I couldn't release it on BigBoss and it's home is mousai2.ikilledappl3.tk/ I figured why not let others have a shot in making other tweaks out of it. 
For those who want to use a tweak that manages your music... Why not use MusicMod instead? 
Mousai2 was also going to have a Spotify functionality but I didn't feel like making a competitor to BdaySpotify since that tweak deserves to have recoginiton. And the code for Spotify is commented but feel free to do whatever you want with the code just credit me! :)
